# FizzBuzz - In JavaScript

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple
implementation languages.

This one is JavaScript, originally designed by Brendan Eich in 10 days at Netscape.

```
Always be proud of who you are, and never let anyone tell you these things
* That you are less than someone else.
* That you do not deserve the same chance at happiness as everyone else.
* That you should change who you are to make other people feel comfortable.
```

In memory of Alan Mathison Turing, and all LGBT+ technologists who have changed the world.
